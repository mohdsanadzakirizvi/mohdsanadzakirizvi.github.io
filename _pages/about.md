I'm a Graduate Student Researcher at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I focus on enhancing factual and faithful reasoning in large language models, advised by [Dr. Pasquale Minervini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pasquale-minervini-phd-47a08324/).

Previously, I worked at [Google Research India](https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/) with [Dr. Partha Talukdar](https://research.google/people/parthatalukdar/), concentrating on entity-aware and neural speech translation to improve cross-lingual video access for low-resource languages. 

Before that, I was with [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I developed tools for language identification and code-mixed text generation under the guidance of [Dr. Monojit Choudhury](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monojit-choudhury-54225898/), [Dr. Sunayana Sitaram](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/susitara/), [Dr. Kalika Bali](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kalikab/) and [Tanuja Ganu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanujabapat/).

My early career involved diverse roles, including a Data Scientist position at Analytics Vidhya, where I co-instructed NLP MOOCs and authored [popular technical blogs](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/author/mohdsanadzakirizvigmail-com/) on Data Science, ML, NLP and AI.
